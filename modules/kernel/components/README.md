# 🧠 SpawnEngine Kernel Components

This folder contains **core UI components** that form the base of the MeshOS Dashboard.

### Components Overview
- `MeshKernelDashboard.jsx` — Main dashboard shell that assembles stats, XP, quests, and feed.
- `HeaderStatus.jsx` — Header bar with status, wallet, and alerts.
- `StatsGrid.jsx` — Displays key metrics such as total packs and volume.
- `XPPanel.jsx` — Shows XP progress and level-up bar.
- `QuestSummary.jsx` — Lists active quests and completion status.
- `FeedPanel.jsx` — Live mesh event feed.
- `RealtimeFeed.jsx` — Simulated real-time feed updates.
- `FooterNav.jsx` — Compact navigation footer for quick switching.

These are production-ready and expect live data via `props`. Minimal mock data is included for structure and design visibility.
